# Points of Interest Recommendation System in Recife with Content-Based Filtering and Pernambuco Passport

## Project Overview

Recife has significant tourism potential but requires digital solutions to promote its Points of Interest (POIs). Thus, the implementation of an intelligent system represents an innovation opportunity for the sector. A Content-Based Recommendation System was proposed, which uses similarity metrics to correlate user preferences with POI characteristics. 
The system achieved 79% precision, 100% minimum hit rate, and 86% coverage, demonstrating strong performance in cold start scenarios despite the overexposure of some POIs. Therefore, the model proved effective in providing personalized recommendations, showing potential to boost local tourism.
